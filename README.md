•	Topic
Using data from a temporary employment agency, we are looking for relationships with the ultimate goal of finding what makes employees and/or the recruiting agency the most money. Possible relationships include location/wages/return (i.e. Akron vs. Chicago), marketing postings/wages/return (i.e. Craigslist, Indeed, etc.). The end result should be a solid visualization of the data including graphs, maps and other charts or tables. 

•	Data Set
We are using a data set from a previous, unrelated, project done by Stefan. It includes unique employee IDs, pay rates, billing rates, hours worked, location, 14 different branches, where the job was posted and profit. It is an immense data set with over 6000 unique instances of employment. The data needs some cleaning for efficiency (specifically formatting).

•	Inspiration
We decided that it’s no longer viable to do sports related projects as we have developed a stronger competency in JavaScript, SQL, Python, etc. We wanted to do something business related to show an understanding of how business relationships work and answer a question that can help a business/those they employ make more money. We also believe that the data set is versatile and can show many different relationships that are well visualized.
